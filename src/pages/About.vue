    <p>Tone poems was something I started a couple years ago for arts sake. This is a complete overhaul of the same concept. The only thing in common is an audio engine (and I revised that too).
    When I revisited the old version I noticed it contained a lot of features only practical for musicians and was overly complex. So I wanted this version to be simple and more intuitive. Hope you enjoy!</p>
