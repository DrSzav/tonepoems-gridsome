  </br>
    <p>Tone poems was something I started a couple years ago because I wanted to apply everything I've learned in computer science to create something truly unique and inpsiring.
    </br> This is a complete overhaul of the original website, which I admit had a strong bias towards electronic music producers... The new tone poems is minimal as I could allow, and about 300% more magical! Hope you enjoy!</p>
